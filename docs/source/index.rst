Promptmeteo ðŸ”¥ðŸ§”
=======================================

Promptmeteo is a Python library for prompt engineering built over LangChain. It simplifies the utilization of large language models (LLMs) for various tasks through a low-code interface. To achieve this, Promptmeteo can employ different LLM models and dynamically generate prompts for specific tasks based on just a few configuration parameters.
