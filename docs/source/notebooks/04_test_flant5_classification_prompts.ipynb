The box which, actually, was shipped from Office Depot was damaged when it arrived; however, the cartridges appear not to be damaged. I'll find out for sure when I install them (not all at the same time). An interesting thing about my order: I wanted a box of 2 black cartridges, also, but there was a delivery charge on them because the order would be fulfilled by Office Depot - there was free shipping on the color cartridges (fulfilled by Amazon). Rather than pay shipping on the black cartridges, I bought them at the local Walmart for the same price as through Amazon -- no shipping charges. The interesting thing was that when the color cartridges arrived, they had been shipped by Office Depot -- no shipping charges on them. Why shipping charges on black but not color -- price on each was more than the $25 amount required for free shipping and both shipped from Office Depot? Doesn't make sense to me. \n",

Rather than pay shipping on the black cartridges, I bought them at the local Walmart for the same price as through Amazon -- no shipping charges. The interesting thing was that when the color cartridges arrived, they had been shipped by Office Depot -- no shipping charges on them. Why shipping charges on black but not color -- price on each was more than the $25 amount required for free shipping and both shipped from Office Depot? Doesn't make sense to me. \n",

I'll find out for sure when I install them (not all at the same time). An interesting thing about my order: I wanted a box of 2 black cartridges, also, but there was a delivery charge on them because the order would be fulfilled by Office Depot - there was free shipping on the color cartridges (fulfilled by Amazon). Rather than pay shipping on the black cartridges, I bought them at the local Walmart for the same price as through Amazon -- no shipping charges. The interesting thing was that when the color cartridges arrived, they had been shipped by Office Depot -- no shipping charges on them. Why shipping charges on black but not color -- price on each was more than the $25 amount required for free shipping and both shipped from Office Depot? Doesn't make sense to me. \n",

They do the job of holding the cards, but that's about it. I'm definitely getting a new case for these. If you want to buy, don't take it too seriously. Don't expect all 100 cards to be Unstable, and expect multiples. \n",

Every time I try, I get the error message. Even when I am 10' away from the Wifi unit. I followed the YouTube setup video with no success. When I purchased the unit, I thought it would connect directly to my wife's phone (like Bluetooth). Instead, this scale uses the Wifi router to communicate to the phone. This system is limited to the router connection...which is usually not close to the bedroom unlike a cell phone! I wouldn't recommend this scale to anyone because of the Wifi connection.

I'm giving this 4 stars still due to the simple fact that he LOVES this thing. Purchased right before they sold out, maybe the new model is more durable. Update with new model: The newer model has some areas where design has decreased in quality. The \"tail\" rope is not attached nearly as well as the first one.

I'll find out for sure when I install them (not all at the same time). An interesting thing about my order: I wanted a box of 2 black cartridges, also, but there was a delivery charge on them because the order would be fulfilled by Office Depot - there was free shipping on the color cartridges (fulfilled by Amazon). Rather than pay shipping on the black cartridges, I bought them at the local Walmart for the same price as through Amazon -- no shipping charges. The interesting thing was that when the color cartridges arrived, they had been shipped by Office Depot -- no shipping charges on them. Why shipping charges on black but not color -- price on each was more than the $25 amount required for free shipping and both shipped from Office Depot? Doesn't make sense to me.\n",

This happens on all my devices both Wi-Fi and wired. The only way to restore service was to do a AC power reset. This was happening once or twice a day. Comcast came out, ran a new coax line from the pedestal to the house and boosted the signal level. Same problem. The Arris Tech guys were great but could not solve the problem. Additionally, I lost the 5G service on three occasions. I had to do a factory reset to restore this. I cannot recommend this modem/router based upon my experiences. I purchased a Netgear AC1900 modem/router. It’s fantastic. I’v Had it for over a week with no problems. It’s faster and the range is greater than the Arris. I read online that other people have had problems with the Arris modem/router connected to Comcast. If you have Comcast internet I do not recommend this Arris modem/router.

Of those the Gumdrop is about the best, but it has some serious issues. The case rubber (silicone, whatever) is very smooth and slick, and doesn't give you a lot of confidence when hold the Tab with one hand. The Tab A is heavy so if your laying down watching a video the case slips in your hand so you have to make frequent adjustments. I had to remove the clear plastic shield that covers the screen because it impaired the touch screen operation. This affected the strength of the 1-piece plastic frame the surrounds the Tab A, so now the rubber outer cover feels really flexible and flimsy. Lastly, they made it difficult to get to the S pen. The S pen is in the back bottom right hand corner of the Tab A, and they made the little rubber flap that protects corner swing backwards for access to the S pen. This means in order to get the S pen out, the flap has to swing out 180 degrees. This is really awkward and hard to do with one hand. This case does a good job protecting my Tab A, but with these serious design flaws I can't recommend it unless you have an S pen, then you don't have much choice.\n",

Of those the Gumdrop is about the best, but it has some serious issues. The case rubber (silicone, whatever) is very smooth and slick, and doesn't give you a lot of confidence when hold the Tab with one hand. The Tab A is heavy so if your laying down watching a video the case slips in your hand so you have to make frequent adjustments. I had to remove the clear plastic shield that covers the screen because it impaired the touch screen operation. This affected the strength of the 1-piece plastic frame the surrounds the Tab A, so now the rubber outer cover feels really flexible and flimsy. Lastly, they made it difficult to get to the S pen. The S pen is in the back bottom right hand corner of the Tab A, and they made the little rubber flap that protects corner swing backwards for access to the S pen. This means in order to get the S pen out, the flap has to swing out 180 degrees. This is really awkward and hard to do with one hand. This case does a good job protecting my Tab A, but with these serious design flaws I can't recommend it unless you have an S pen, then you don't have much choice.\n",

      "INPUT: 3 1/2 Stars Remedy is a brothers best friend romance as well as a second chance romance mixed into one. It's a unique story, and the hero (Grady) has to do everything to get Collins back and prove he's the guy for her. Three years ago, Grady and Collins had an amazing night together. Collins thought she was finally getting everything she dreamed of, her brothers best friend... but when she woke up alone the next morning, and never heard from her, things definitely changed. Now Grady is back, and he's not leaving, and he's doing everything in his power to prove to her why he left, and that he's not giving her up this time around. While I loved the premise of this story, and at times Grady, he really got on my nerves. I totally understand his reasoning for leaving that night, but to not even send a letter to Collins explaining himself? To leave her wondering and hurt for all those years, and then expect her to welcome him back with open arms? Was he delusional?! Collins was right to be upset, angry, hurt, etc. She was right to put up a fight with him when he wanted her back and to move forward. I admire her will power, because Grady was persistent. I loved Collins in this book, she was strong, and she guarded her heart, and I admired her for that. Sure she loved Grady, but she was scared, and hesitant to let him back in her life, who wouldn't be after what he did to her? Her character was definitely my favorite out of the two. She definitely let things go at the pace she wanted, and when she was ready to listen, she listened. There is a lot of angst in this book, and I did enjoy watching these two reconnect when Collins started to forgive Grady, I just wish Grady would have not come off as so whiney and would have been a little more understanding. He kept saying he understood, but at times he was a little too pushy to me, and then he was sweet towards the end. I ended up loving him just as much as Collins, but in the beginning of the book, I had a hard time reading his points of view because I couldn't connect with his character. The first part of this book, was not my favorite, but he second part? I adored, hence my rating. If you like second chance, and brothers best friend romances, you may really enjoy this book, I just had a hard time with Grady at first and how he handled some of the things he did.\n",

Sometimes a challenge to move around due to the chew toys hanging off but gives our puppy something to knaw on throughout the night. 5 month update: Our dog doesn't destroy many toys but since he truly loves this one he has ripped off the head, the tail rope, torn a few corner rope rings, put teeth marks in the internal foam and now ripped the underside of the cover. I'm giving this 4 stars still due to the simple fact that he LOVES this thing. Purchased right before they sold out, maybe the new model is more durable. Update with new model: The newer model has some areas where design has decreased in quality. The \"tail\" rope is not attached nearly as well as the first one. However, so far nothing has been ripped off of it in the 3 weeks since we have received it. He still loves it though!\n",

Of those the Gumdrop is about the best, but it has some serious issues. The case rubber (silicone, whatever) is very smooth and slick, and doesn't give you a lot of confidence when hold the Tab with one hand. The Tab A is heavy so if your laying down watching a video the case slips in your hand so you have to make frequent adjustments. I had to remove the clear plastic shield that covers the screen because it impaired the touch screen operation. This affected the strength of the 1-piece plastic frame the surrounds the Tab A, so now the rubber outer cover feels really flexible and flimsy. Lastly, they made it difficult to get to the S pen. The S pen is in the back bottom right hand corner of the Tab A, and they made the little rubber flap that protects corner swing backwards for access to the S pen. This means in order to get the S pen out, the flap has to swing out 180 degrees. This is really awkward and hard to do with one hand. This case does a good job protecting my Tab A, but with these serious design flaws I can't recommend it unless you have an S pen, then you don't have much choice.\n",

Sometimes a challenge to move around due to the chew toys hanging off but gives our puppy something to knaw on throughout the night. 5 month update: Our dog doesn't destroy many toys but since he truly loves this one he has ripped off the head, the tail rope, torn a few corner rope rings, put teeth marks in the internal foam and now ripped the underside of the cover. I'm giving this 4 stars still due to the simple fact that he LOVES this thing. Purchased right before they sold out, maybe the new model is more durable. Update with new model: The newer model has some areas where design has decreased in quality. The \"tail\" rope is not attached nearly as well as the first one. However, so far nothing has been ripped off of it in the 3 weeks since we have received it. He still loves it though!\n",

      "INPUT: This case is ok, but not exceptional - a 3.5 or 4 max. The issue is there are fewer cases available for the Tab A 10.1 w S pen. Of those the Gumdrop is about the best, but it has some serious issues. The case rubber (silicone, whatever) is very smooth and slick, and doesn't give you a lot of confidence when hold the Tab with one hand. The Tab A is heavy so if your laying down watching a video the case slips in your hand so you have to make frequent adjustments. I had to remove the clear plastic shield that covers the screen because it impaired the touch screen operation. This affected the strength of the 1-piece plastic frame the surrounds the Tab A, so now the rubber outer cover feels really flexible and flimsy. Lastly, they made it difficult to get to the S pen. The S pen is in the back bottom right hand corner of the Tab A, and they made the little rubber flap that protects corner swing backwards for access to the S pen. This means in order to get the S pen out, the flap has to swing out 180 degrees. This is really awkward and hard to do with one hand. This case does a good job protecting my Tab A, but with these serious design flaws I can't recommend it unless you have an S pen, then you don't have much choice.\n",

      "INPUT: I purchased this for my wife in October, 2017. At the time, we were in the middle of relocating and living in a hotel. I couldn't get this scale to connect to the Wifi in the hotel. I decided to wait until we moved into our home and I could set up my own Wifi system. March 2018- I have set up my Wifi system and this scale still won't connect. Every time I try, I get the error message. Even when I am 10' away from the Wifi unit. I followed the YouTube setup video with no success. When I purchased the unit, I thought it would connect directly to my wife's phone (like Bluetooth). Instead, this scale uses the Wifi router to communicate to the phone. This system is limited to the router connection...which is usually not close to the bedroom unlike a cell phone! I wouldn't recommend this scale to anyone because of the Wifi connection. Instead, please look at systems that use Bluetooth for communication. I am replacing this with a Bluetooth connection scale.\n",

Sometimes a challenge to move around due to the chew toys hanging off but gives our puppy something to knaw on throughout the night. 5 month update: Our dog doesn't destroy many toys but since he truly loves this one he has ripped off the head, the tail rope, torn a few corner rope rings, put teeth marks in the internal foam and now ripped the underside of the cover. I'm giving this 4 stars still due to the simple fact that he LOVES this thing. Purchased right before they sold out, maybe the new model is more durable. Update with new model: The newer model has some areas where design has decreased in quality. The \"tail\" rope is not attached nearly as well as the first one.

An interesting thing about my order: I wanted a box of 2 black cartridges, also, but there was a delivery charge on them because the order would be fulfilled by Office Depot - there was free shipping on the color cartridges (fulfilled by Amazon). Rather than pay shipping on the black cartridges, I bought them at the local Walmart for the same price as through Amazon -- no shipping charges. The interesting thing was that when the color cartridges arrived, they had been shipped by Office Depot -- no shipping charges on them. Why shipping charges on black but not color -- price on each was more than the $25 amount required for free shipping and both shipped from Office Depot? Doesn't make sense to me.\n",

Comcast came out, ran a new coax line from the pedestal to the house and boosted the signal level. Same problem. The Arris Tech guys were great but could not solve the problem. Additionally, I lost the 5G service on three occasions. I had to do a factory reset to restore this. I cannot recommend this modem/router based upon my experiences. I purchased a Netgear AC1900 modem/router. It’s fantastic. I’v Had it for over a week with no problems. It’s faster and the range is greater than the Arris.

      "INPUT: 3 1/2 Stars Remedy is a brothers best friend romance as well as a second chance romance mixed into one. It's a unique story, and the hero (Grady) has to do everything to get Collins back and prove he's the guy for her. Three years ago, Grady and Collins had an amazing night together. Collins thought she was finally getting everything she dreamed of, her brothers best friend... but when she woke up alone the next morning, and never heard from her, things definitely changed. Now Grady is back, and he's not leaving, and he's doing everything in his power to prove to her why he left, and that he's not giving her up this time around. While I loved the premise of this story, and at times Grady, he really got on my nerves. I totally understand his reasoning for leaving that night, but to not even send a letter to Collins explaining himself? To leave her wondering and hurt for all those years, and then expect her to welcome him back with open arms? Was he delusional?! Collins was right to be upset, angry, hurt, etc. She was right to put up a fight with him when he wanted her back and to move forward. I admire her will power, because Grady was persistent. I loved Collins in this book, she was strong, and she guarded her heart, and I admired her for that. Sure she loved Grady, but she was scared, and hesitant to let him back in her life, who wouldn't be after what he did to her? Her character was definitely my favorite out of the two. She definitely let things go at the pace she wanted, and when she was ready to listen, she listened. There is a lot of angst in this book, and I did enjoy watching these two reconnect when Collins started to forgive Grady, I just wish Grady would have not come off as so whiney and would have been a little more understanding. He kept saying he understood, but at times he was a little too pushy to me, and then he was sweet towards the end. I ended up loving him just as much as Collins, but in the beginning of the book, I had a hard time reading his points of view because I couldn't connect with his character. The first part of this book, was not my favorite, but he second part? I adored, hence my rating. If you like second chance, and brothers best friend romances, you may really enjoy this book, I just had a hard time with Grady at first and how he handled some of the things he did.\n",

The S pen is in the back bottom right hand corner of the Tab A, and they made the little rubber flap that protects corner swing backwards for access to the S pen.

Every time I try, I get the error message. Even when I am 10' away from the Wifi unit. I followed the YouTube setup video with no success. When I purchased the unit, I thought it would connect directly to my wife's phone (like Bluetooth). Instead, this scale uses the Wifi router to communicate to the phone. This system is limited to the router connection...which is usually not close to the bedroom unlike a cell phone! I wouldn't recommend this scale to anyone because of the Wifi connection.

Of those the Gumdrop is about the best, but it has some serious issues. The case rubber (silicone, whatever) is very smooth and slick, and doesn't give you a lot of confidence when hold the Tab with one hand. The Tab A is heavy so if your laying down watching a video the case slips in your hand so you have to make frequent adjustments. I had to remove the clear plastic shield that covers the screen because it impaired the touch screen operation. This affected the strength of the 1-piece plastic frame the surrounds the Tab A, so now the rubber outer cover feels really flexible and flimsy. Lastly, they made it difficult to get to the S pen. The S pen is in the back bottom right hand corner of the Tab A, and they made the little rubber flap that protects corner swing backwards for access to the S pen. This means in order to get the S pen out, the flap has to swing out 180 degrees. This is really awkward and hard to do with one hand. This case does a good job protecting my Tab A, but with these serious design flaws I can't recommend it unless you have an S pen, then you don't have much choice.\n",

Sometimes a challenge to move around due to the chew toys hanging off but gives our puppy something to knaw on throughout the night. 5 month update: Our dog doesn't destroy many toys but since he truly loves this one he has ripped off the head, the tail rope, torn a few corner rope rings, put teeth marks in the internal foam and now ripped the underside of the cover. I'm giving this 4 stars still due to the simple fact that he LOVES this thing. Purchased right before they sold out, maybe the new model is more durable. Update with new model: The newer model has some areas where design has decreased in quality. The \"tail\" rope is not attached nearly as well as the first one. However, so far nothing has been ripped off of it in the 3 weeks since we have received it. He still loves it though!\n",

      "INPUT: 3 1/2 Stars Remedy is a brothers best friend romance as well as a second chance romance mixed into one. It's a unique story, and the hero (Grady) has to do everything to get Collins back and prove he's the guy for her. Three years ago, Grady and Collins had an amazing night together. Collins thought she was finally getting everything she dreamed of, her brothers best friend... but when she woke up alone the next morning, and never heard from her, things definitely changed. Now Grady is back, and he's not leaving, and he's doing everything in his power to prove to her why he left, and that he's not giving her up this time around. While I loved the premise of this story, and at times Grady, he really got on my nerves. I totally understand his reasoning for leaving that night, but to not even send a letter to Collins explaining himself? To leave her wondering and hurt for all those years, and then expect her to welcome him back with open arms? Was he delusional?! Collins was right to be upset, angry, hurt, etc. She was right to put up a fight with him when he wanted her back and to move forward. I admire her will power, because Grady was persistent. I loved Collins in this book, she was strong, and she guarded her heart, and I admired her for that. Sure she loved Grady, but she was scared, and hesitant to let him back in her life, who wouldn't be after what he did to her? Her character was definitely my favorite out of the two. She definitely let things go at the pace she wanted, and when she was ready to listen, she listened. There is a lot of angst in this book, and I did enjoy watching these two reconnect when Collins started to forgive Grady, I just wish Grady would have not come off as so whiney and would have been a little more understanding. He kept saying he understood, but at times he was a little too pushy to me, and then he was sweet towards the end. I ended up loving him just as much as Collins, but in the beginning of the book, I had a hard time reading his points of view because I couldn't connect with his character. The first part of this book, was not my favorite, but he second part? I adored, hence my rating. If you like second chance, and brothers best friend romances, you may really enjoy this book, I just had a hard time with Grady at first and how he handled some of the things he did.\n",

I understand that Slaughter brings some of the characters from the Grant County series to this series. The crimes are brutal.

Rather than pay shipping on the black cartridges, I bought them at the local Walmart for the same price as through Amazon -- no shipping charges. The interesting thing was that when the color cartridges arrived, they had been shipped by Office Depot -- no shipping charges on them. Why shipping charges on black but not color -- price on each was more than the $25 amount required for free shipping and both shipped from Office Depot? Doesn't make sense to me.\n",

Comcast came out, ran a new coax line from the pedestal to the house and boosted the signal level. Same problem. The Arris Tech guys were great but could not solve the problem. Additionally, I lost the 5G service on three occasions. I had to do a factory reset to restore this. I cannot recommend this modem/router based upon my experiences. I purchased a Netgear AC1900 modem/router. It’s fantastic. I’v Had it for over a week with no problems. It’s faster and the range is greater than the Arris.

I'm giving this 4 stars still due to the simple fact that he LOVES this thing. Purchased right before they sold out, maybe the new model is more durable.

The Tab A is heavy so if your laying down watching a video the case slips in your hand so you have to make frequent adjustments. I had to remove the clear plastic shield that covers the screen because it impaired the touch screen operation. This affected the strength of the 1-piece plastic frame the surrounds the Tab A, so now the rubber outer cover feels really flexible and flimsy. Lastly, they made it difficult to get to the S pen. The S pen is in the back bottom right hand corner of the Tab A, and they made the little rubber flap that protects corner swing backwards for access to the S pen. This means in order to get the S pen out, the flap has to swing out 180 degrees. This is really awkward and hard to do with one hand.

      "INPUT: 3 1/2 Stars Remedy is a brothers best friend romance as well as a second chance romance mixed into one. It's a unique story, and the hero (Grady) has to do everything to get Collins back and prove he's the guy for her. Three years ago, Grady and Collins had an amazing night together. Collins thought she was finally getting everything she dreamed of, her brothers best friend... but when she woke up alone the next morning, and never heard from her, things definitely changed. Now Grady is back, and he's not leaving, and he's doing everything in his power to prove to her why he left, and that he's not giving her up this time around. While I loved the premise of this story, and at times Grady, he really got on my nerves. I totally understand his reasoning for leaving that night, but to not even send a letter to Collins explaining himself? To leave her wondering and hurt for all those years, and then expect her to welcome him back with open arms? Was he delusional?! Collins was right to be upset, angry, hurt, etc. She was right to put up a fight with him when he wanted her back and to move forward. I admire her will power, because Grady was persistent. I loved Collins in this book, she was strong, and she guarded her heart, and I admired her for that. Sure she loved Grady, but she was scared, and hesitant to let him back in her life, who wouldn't be after what he did to her? Her character was definitely my favorite out of the two. She definitely let things go at the pace she wanted, and when she was ready to listen, she listened. There is a lot of angst in this book, and I did enjoy watching these two reconnect when Collins started to forgive Grady, I just wish Grady would have not come off as so whiney and would have been a little more understanding. He kept saying he understood, but at times he was a little too pushy to me, and then he was sweet towards the end. I ended up loving him just as much as Collins, but in the beginning of the book, I had a hard time reading his points of view because I couldn't connect with his character. The first part of this book, was not my favorite, but he second part? I adored, hence my rating. If you like second chance, and brothers best friend romances, you may really enjoy this book, I just had a hard time with Grady at first and how he handled some of the things he did.\n",

I'm giving this 4 stars still due to the simple fact that he LOVES this thing. Purchased right before they sold out, maybe the new model is more durable. Update with new model: The newer model has some areas where design has decreased in quality. The \"tail\" rope is not attached nearly as well as the first one.

Of those the Gumdrop is about the best, but it has some serious issues. The case rubber (silicone, whatever) is very smooth and slick, and doesn't give you a lot of confidence when hold the Tab with one hand. The Tab A is heavy so if your laying down watching a video the case slips in your hand so you have to make frequent adjustments. I had to remove the clear plastic shield that covers the screen because it impaired the touch screen operation. This affected the strength of the 1-piece plastic frame the surrounds the Tab A, so now the rubber outer cover feels really flexible and flimsy. Lastly, they made it difficult to get to the S pen. The S pen is in the back bottom right hand corner of the Tab A, and they made the little rubber flap that protects corner swing backwards for access to the S pen. This means in order to get the S pen out, the flap has to swing out 180 degrees. This is really awkward and hard to do with one hand. This case does a good job protecting my Tab A, but with these serious design flaws I can't recommend it unless you have an S pen, then you don't have much choice.\n",

      "INPUT: This case is ok, but not exceptional - a 3.5 or 4 max. The issue is there are fewer cases available for the Tab A 10.1 w S pen. Of those the Gumdrop is about the best, but it has some serious issues. The case rubber (silicone, whatever) is very smooth and slick, and doesn't give you a lot of confidence when hold the Tab with one hand. The Tab A is heavy so if your laying down watching a video the case slips in your hand so you have to make frequent adjustments. I had to remove the clear plastic shield that covers the screen because it impaired the touch screen operation. This affected the strength of the 1-piece plastic frame the surrounds the Tab A, so now the rubber outer cover feels really flexible and flimsy. Lastly, they made it difficult to get to the S pen. The S pen is in the back bottom right hand corner of the Tab A, and they made the little rubber flap that protects corner swing backwards for access to the S pen. This means in order to get the S pen out, the flap has to swing out 180 degrees. This is really awkward and hard to do with one hand. This case does a good job protecting my Tab A, but with these serious design flaws I can't recommend it unless you have an S pen, then you don't have much choice.\n",

To the actual quality the fur seems of a fair (not great but not terrible quality but the tail isnt fully stuffed.) Apparently theres supposed to be a wire to pose the tail.

Por otro lado destacar que ha empezado a oxidarse... Raro ya que el anuncio ponía claramente de Acero Inoxidable... ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ La tecnología llega a nuestras casas... hace unos meses compré una papelera/basura también con sensor de proximidad y apertura automática. Quede muy contento y me arriesgue con este dispensador de jabón. La principal característica y ventaja es que no \"pringas\" nada. Puedes tener las manos llenas de jabón o agua y solo con aproximar la mano al sensor el dispensador se activa. Es muy fácil de utilizar, dispone de dos botones, + y - estos sirven para graduar la descarga del dispensador. Pulsando más de 3 segundos el +, podemos encenderlo o apagarlo. La carga se efectúa por la parte superior desde un tapón de media rosca. Destacar que el dispensador utiliza 4 pilas del tipo A++ que no van incluidas en el paquete. \n",

Quede muy contento y me arriesgue con este dispensador de jabón. La principal característica y ventaja es que no \"pringas\" nada. Puedes tener las manos llenas de jabón o agua y solo con aproximar la mano al sensor el dispensador se activa. Es muy fácil de utilizar, dispone de dos botones, + y - estos sirven para graduar la descarga del dispensador. Pulsando más de 3 segundos el +, podemos encenderlo o apagarlo.

Por otro lado destacar que ha empezado a oxidarse... Raro ya que el anuncio ponía claramente de Acero Inoxidable... ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ La tecnología llega a nuestras casas... hace unos meses compré una papelera/basura también con sensor de proximidad y apertura automática. Quede muy contento y me arriesgue con este dispensador de jabón. La principal característica y ventaja es que no \"pringas\" nada. Puedes tener las manos llenas de jabón o agua y solo con aproximar la mano al sensor el dispensador se activa. Es muy fácil de utilizar, dispone de dos botones, + y - estos sirven para graduar la descarga del dispensador. Pulsando más de 3 segundos el +, podemos encenderlo o apagarlo. La carga se efectúa por la parte superior desde un tapón de media rosca. Destacar que el dispensador utiliza 4 pilas del tipo A++ que no van incluidas en el paquete. \n",

Sólo lo he conectado para probar las luces (azules) y si colocas un dispositivo para cargar, estás parpadean muy lentamente unas 5 veces y luego se apagan definitivamente, cosa que es de agradecer si lo vas a usar en tu mesa de noche. Por ahora lo recomiendo estéticamente, luego informaré de su funcionamiento.\n",

Ni whatsapp ni facebook, ni nada se puede usar. El reloj necesitaría otra tarjeta SIM para hacer llamadas sin conectarse al teléfono por bluetooth pero eso significa que te cobrarán unos cuatro euros más en tu operador de telefonia cada mes. El bluetooth es malísimo y no llega ni a unos centímetros, con lo cual no me llegaba ni de la muñeca hasta los cascos de las orejas. Para correr y escuchar música y mirar la hora...te durará media hora y eso con suerte y si tienes la suerte de que te llegue la señal a tus cascos desde el brazo.

Quede muy contento y me arriesgue con este dispensador de jabón. La principal característica y ventaja es que no \"pringas\" nada. Puedes tener las manos llenas de jabón o agua y solo con aproximar la mano al sensor el dispensador se activa. Es muy fácil de utilizar, dispone de dos botones, + y - estos sirven para graduar la descarga del dispensador. Pulsando más de 3 segundos el +, podemos encenderlo o apagarlo. La carga se efectúa por la parte superior desde un tapón de media rosca. Destacar que el dispensador utiliza 4 pilas del tipo A++ que no van incluidas en el paquete.\n",

Lo que funciona es la calculadora,el reproductor de música, lo de contar los pasos y poco más. No sirve para nada poder mandar SMS, que cuestan dinero y nadie utiliza casi para nada, si no puedes utilizar el whatsapp, que es lo que todos tenemos y necesitamos. Ni whatsapp ni facebook, ni nada se puede usar. El reloj necesitaría otra tarjeta SIM para hacer llamadas sin conectarse al teléfono por bluetooth pero eso significa que te cobrarán unos cuatro euros más en tu operador de telefonia cada mes. El bluetooth es malísimo y no llega ni a unos centímetros, con lo cual no me llegaba ni de la muñeca hasta los cascos de las orejas. Para correr y escuchar música y mirar la hora...te durará media hora y eso con suerte y si tienes la suerte de que te llegue la señal a tus cascos desde el brazo. Muy muy muy decepcionada con este producto. Devuelto al día siguiente. Una tomadura de pelo.\n",

Probablemente sea más culpa del switch pero no he conseguido dar con alguno que no de ese problema, cosa que no me ocurría con un router estandard de los de asus con 4 bocas. También he experimentado problemas y he tenido que reconfigurar equipos como un NAS y demás En fin, para un instalación simple de router y todo wifi más acces point vale, pero no lo recomendaría si tienes una configuración algo más compleja\n",
